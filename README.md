# Healthy Geek Cooks
[Healthy Geek Cooks](https://healthy-geek-cooks.herokuapp.com/) is a full-stack project that allows users to search, browse,
share and create their own collection of geeky recipes inspired by dishes featured in fantasy fictions and games, such as
[World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/) and [Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-throne).

Unlike existing recipe websites, this app aims to celebrate geekiness with a healthy twist. The app encourages users to come up
with creative recipes low in fat, sugar, or carb, or gluten free.
